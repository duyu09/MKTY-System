**Project Title:** Design and Implementation of *Minh Khoe Tue Y* -  a Health Management and Assisted Diagnosis System Based on LLM and Multimodal Artificial Intelligence  (Abbreviation: Minh Khoe Tue Y Smart Healthcare System, _MKTY_, **Simplified Chinese**: 明康慧医 - 基于LLM与多模态人工智能的健康管理与辅助诊疗系统设计与实现 **or** 明康慧医智慧医疗系统, **Vietnamese**: *Minh Khỏe Tuệ Y* - Thiết kế và triển khai hệ thống quản lý sức khỏe và hỗ trợ chẩn đoán y tế dựa trên LLM và trí tuệ nhân tạo đa mô thức)

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage large-scale language models (LLM) and multimodal artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the intelligence and personalization of health management and assisted diagnosis systems. Through our innovative "LLM discussion mechanism," which reduces the hallucination effect in large models, and multimodal data analysis methods, the system can intelligently process patients' multimodal electronic health records and health information to provide accurate diagnostic recommendations. This reduces the burden on doctors and improves diagnostic efficiency. The system also supports self-diagnosis for patients, helping users to proactively prevent diseases, reducing unnecessary medical visits, and optimizing healthcare resource allocation. 

Incorporating multimodal technology, the system can integrate various data sources in the medical field, including text and medical images, thus enhancing the precision and scientific basis of clinical decision-making and promoting the intelligent development of healthcare services. Furthermore, the system features a medical knowledge base function, where users can freely share high-quality medical knowledge. Users can perform multimodal intelligent searches for knowledge within the system and utilize the knowledge to enhance the content generation of _MKTY LLM_.

In summary, this project explores the deep integration of AI and medicine, providing a technical paradigm and practical experience for future applications in the healthcare field.
